Must have:
1. Menu (my plans, create plan(by type))
2. Creatable plans view
3. Create football plan
4. Create agility plan (perhaps can be merged with football plan creation, grooming about customer inputs)
5. My plan list view
6. A plan view (update, delete)
7. Registration and login (firebase auth) (email+)

99. Admin interface? (user mgmt, create groups..etc)

Performance:
1. Quick plan creator (https://www.freetrainers.com/exercise/calendar/)
2. breadcrumb

Delighters:
1. My plan list view (delete, share with group(with world?), copy/duplicate all with icons)
2. public plans view (same as my plans, copy/duplicate)
3. public plan view (readonly) (copy, comment?)
4. Football animation creator (+1, -1, )
5. sms or fb message about daily training

Future:
1. Dashboard (various block like new public plans, got rating for plans...etc) perhaps we dont need this
